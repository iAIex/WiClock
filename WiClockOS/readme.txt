Before starting, you have to download Python 2.7 (32bit) and Pygame with the latest release (32bit)!

To test the v1.0 of WiClockOS, start widgets.py
To add custom fonts, add a file ended with .font in the font folder, look into the default5x3.font
for for the syntax.
To add custom source files, put files ended with .bsrc into the source folder, look into smiley.bsrc for the syntax.

Completed so far:
- basic simulator for windows using PyGame
- basic interpreter and pre-parser
- add-on support (third party support)
- module support (third party support)
- MAX7219 Display driver


To-Do:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- interface to the GPIOS of the raspberry (highest priority !)
- static values (maybe outsourced to modules)
- milliseconds as variable (maybe outsourced to modules)
